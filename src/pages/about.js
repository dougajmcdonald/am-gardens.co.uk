      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I have over ten years of practical experience working in gardens across
        the south of England, from Bristol, Bath, and Wiltshire, to London and
        Surrey.
      </p>
      <p>
        From expansive, modern gardens of professional footballers to small
        inner-city sanctuaries and large scale commercial sites, I have worked
        to the highest standards for clients who expect the best.
      </p>
      <p>And now I want to work with you!</p>
      <p>
        Based in Bristol, I offer a friendly, positive and personal service with
        a commitment to satisfaction whatever the scale and nature of the work.
      </p>
      <p className="font-bold">
        Please get in touch to find out how I can bring my passion for
        horticultural to your outdoor spaces.
