      <h2>Garden maintenance</h2>
      <h3>Grass Cutting</h3>
      <p>
        Often the first thing we notice when entering a garden is the lawn, and
        understandably many people take great pride in it. Allowing for the lawn
        to be cut regularly throughout the growing season keeps the lawn healthy
        and removes debris before it can accumulate, and also encourages the
        lawn to thicken by encouraging horizontal growth.
      </p>
      <h3>Lawn Care</h3>
      <p>
        A healthy lawn is about more than just regular cutting. Lawns must be
        fertilised to encourage growth. It is also important to scarify to
        remove moss and thatch from the base of the stems, as well as aerating
        the soil at the same time. After scarifying, it may also be necessary to
        top-dress the lawn to aid the repair of severely affected areas. Edging
        a lawn is also imperative to keep it looking neat and defining its
        perimeter.
      </p>
      <h3>Hedge Cutting and Topiary</h3>
      <p>
        It's easy for hedges to become overgrown, either through neglect or a
        fear of taking off too much at the wrong time. By allowing me to take
        this on for you, you can rest assured your hedges will be tidy all year
        round and we can restructure anything that has got out of hand and bring
        it back down to a manageable size.
      </p>
      <h3>Pruning</h3>
      <p>
        This is an aspect I take great pride in and a technique that I have
        directly transferred from work on my collection of bonsai trees.
        Accurate pruning and at the correct time of year helps the plant
        maintain healthy growth and structure, as well as often encouraging more
        blooms, and helping to irradicate diseased limbs.
      </p>
      <h3>Planting</h3>
      <p>
        As simple as this sounds, poorly planted plants inhibit growth more than
        anything else you might see with new stock. By allowing me to do this,
        we can pick the correct location for new plants and make sure its
        planted at the correct depth and with the correct nutrients and soil to
        give it a helping hand as it establishes itself in your garden.
      </p>
      <h2>Garden design</h2>
      <h3>Garden design and planning</h3>
      <p>
        Everybody deserves to have the garden of their dreams, but unfortunately
        few houses come with these pre-made. If you have grand plans or just
        want to repurpose a certain feature in your garden, we can work
        something to get the best from your garden for you. I can also create
        structured plans to get the best from your existing garden as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Soft landscaping</h3>
      <p>
        As peoples lives change whether it be due to new additions to the family
        or restricted mobility, or anything else for that matter, so can the
        requirements of their garden. Whether you need a new path added for
        easier access or more productive use of your space by adding raised beds
        to grow veg, or even a new pond to encourage wildlife, we can discuss
        your needs and create a solution to best fit.
      </p>
      <h3>Cultivation</h3>
      <p>
        Often buying new stock from garden centres can be an expensive game and
        does not offer the variety you may hope for. Where people want bespoke
        solutions I am happy growing from seed, from bedding plants to trees, as
        long as you are happy to wait a little longer, this can be an effective
        way to keep costs down and get the plants you desire.
      </p>
      <h3>Habitat Construction and Ecological Consideration</h3>
      <p>
        With Mother Nature struggling with our input, many of us are now trying
        to offer a helping hand in our gardens and this is an approach that I
        thoroughly encourage. Habitat construction such as log piles and
        specific insect habitats, as well as bird feeders and specific plant
        choices, can all help to encourage wildlife back into our gardens by
        creating safe havens and abundant food supplies. most of these
        environments can be created with existing sources in your garden and I
        will happily talk through any options with you.
      </p>
      <h3>Turfing and Seeding</h3>
      <p>
        When a new patch of grass is required, turfing is the obvious option and
        can create magnificent results in shorter periods. The only issue is the
        cost. Where cost is of concern, the next alternative is to seed from
        scratch or to repair areas. Of course, this takes longer to take, but
        the results can be just as beautiful. I can offer both and the aftercare
        to keep them in tip-top shape.
      </p>
      <h2>Garden clearing</h2>
      <h3>Weeding and Bed Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Let's face it, weeding is the last thing most people want to do in their
        gardens, so why not let me take the strain. By keeping your beds
        weed-free it avoids the spread of unwanted growth and helps create space
        for your desired plants to grow into. Keeping the soil turned stops the
        soil from compacting too much and keeps it easy to work. At this stage
        mulching or adding manure to the soil can help to improve the quality of
        your soil giving a more fertile environment for your plants to thrive
        in.
      </p>
      <h3>Spraying</h3>
      <p>
        I have PA1 and PA6 spraying certification, which means that if you do
        choose to use chemicals in your garden, you can rest assured that they
        are being used safely and professionally without overuse or fear of
        contamination of other plants or water sources.
      </p>
      <h3>Green Waste Removal</h3>
      <p>
        Even if you simply have an excess of garden waste that you can't fit in
        your green bin. As a registered waste carrier, I can arrange to remove
        this for you for an agreed fee.
